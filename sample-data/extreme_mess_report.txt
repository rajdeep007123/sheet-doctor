SECTION 3 — ISSUES FOUND
🚨 Critical (will break imports)
- Some rows have too many or too few columns, which will break imports and shift values into the wrong fields.
  Columns: row structure
  Rows affected: 8
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The header row appears again inside the data, which will be treated as a broken data row during import.
  Columns: row structure
  Rows affected: 1
  Auto-fixable: ✅

⚠️  Warning (will cause analysis errors)
- The file uses MacRoman instead of UTF-8, so some systems may misread special characters.
  Columns: file-wide
  Rows affected: 46
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Employee Name column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Employee Name
  Rows affected: 44
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Date column mixes multiple date formats, so the same date may be interpreted differently by different tools.
  Columns: Date
  Rows affected: 42
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Department column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Department
  Rows affected: 42
  Auto-fixable: ❌
- The Department column appears to contain near-duplicate values that differ only slightly, such as spacing or casing changes.
  Columns: Department
  Rows affected: 42
  Auto-fixable: ❌
- The Currency column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Currency
  Rows affected: 41
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Currency column appears to contain near-duplicate values that differ only slightly, such as spacing or casing changes.
  Columns: Currency

- The Amount column appears to contain near-duplicate values that differ only slightly, such as spacing or casing changes.
  Columns: Amount
  Rows affected: 40
  Auto-fixable: ❌
- The Status column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Status
  Rows affected: 39
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Status column appears to contain near-duplicate values that differ only slightly, such as spacing or casing changes.
  Columns: Status
  Rows affected: 39
  Auto-fixable: ❌
- Some characters look corrupted, which may change names, notes, or other text values.
  Columns: file-wide
  Rows affected: 3
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- Completely blank rows are mixed into the file and can interfere with import counts and analysis.
  Columns: row structure
  Rows affected: 2
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Amount column contains outlier values that look unusually large or small compared with the rest of the file.
  Columns: Amount
  Rows affected: 1

ℹ️  Info (cosmetic, worth fixing)
- The Employee Name column appears to contain personally identifiable information that may need extra care before sharing.
  Columns: Employee Name
  Rows affected: 44
  Auto-fixable: ❌

SECTION 4 — COLUMN BREAKDOWN
Employee Name | name | 4.35% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible PII detected (emails/phones/names)
Department | categorical | 8.7% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible duplicates with slight differences
Date | date | 8.7% null | Mixed date formats detected; Inconsistent capitalisation
Amount | currency/amount | 13.04% null | Possible duplicates with slight differences; Outliers detected (values outside 3 standard deviations)
Currency | currency code | 10.87% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible duplicates with slight differences
Category | categorical | 13.04% null | No major issues detected
Status | categorical | 15.22% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible duplicates with slight differences
Notes | free text | 15.22% null | No major issues detected

SECTION 5 — RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. Repair 8 structurally broken row(s) with missing or extra columns (auto-fixable)
2. Remove or quarantine 3 structural row(s) such as blank lines or repeated headers (auto-fixable)
3. Normalize mixed date formats in Date (4 formats across about 42 populated row(s)) (auto-fixable)
4. Review near-duplicate values in Department, Amount, Currency, Status to decide which versions should be merged or kept
5. Manually check outlier values in Amount before trusting totals or downstream analysis
6. Re-decode and normalise text values from MacRoman encoding so names and notes are readable everywhere (auto-fixable)

SECTION 6 — ASSUMPTIONS
• Rows that still contain Excel formulas as text (for example '=SUM(...)') are quarantined because they are not stable data values
• Ambiguous DD/MM vs MM/DD dates: day-first assumed; fallback to month-first if day-first is impossible
• MM-DD-YY two-digit years: treated as 2000–2049 for YY < 50, 1950–1999 for YY ≥ 50
• Unix timestamps: interpreted as UTC; converted to YYYY-MM-DD
• Excel serial dates: Windows epoch (1899-12-30); range 40,000–55,000 treated as dates
• European decimal 1.200,00: detected when period precedes comma; converted to 1200.00
• Combined values like '$1,200 USD' are split so Amount keeps the numeric value and Currency keeps the ISO code
• Blank / N/A / TBD amounts: cleared to empty string and flagged needs_review=TRUE
• "INR ₹" and similar symbol+code combos: symbol stripped, ISO code kept
• "Eng" department abbreviation: kept as-is (expanding abbreviations requires a lookup table)
• Short blank runs in categorical columns are forward-filled when they look like merged-cell export gaps; filled rows are flagged for review
• Rows with long single-cell prose are treated as notes/metadata rather than transactional data
• Rows labelled TOTAL/Subtotal/SUM are quarantined when the amount matches the running total closely enough to look calculated
• Near-duplicate rows (same Name/Amount/Currency/Category, date within 2 days): both kept, both flagged
• Exact duplicates: first occurrence kept; subsequent occurrences removed and logged
• Short rows (< 8 columns): padded with empty strings; flagged needs_review=TRUE
• Metadata export row (sparse, 1/8 fields filled): quarantined as 'Less than 50% columns filled'
