SECTION 3 — ISSUES FOUND
🚨 Critical (will break imports)
- Some rows have too many or too few columns, which will break imports and shift values into the wrong fields.
  Columns: row structure
  Rows affected: 8
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The header row appears again inside the data, which will be treated as a broken data row during import.
  Columns: row structure
  Rows affected: 1
  Auto-fixable: ✅

⚠️  Warning (will cause analysis errors)
- The file uses MacRoman instead of UTF-8, so some systems may misread special characters.
  Columns: file-wide
  Rows affected: 51
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Employee Name column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Employee Name
  Rows affected: 49
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Date column mixes multiple date formats, so the same date may be interpreted differently by different tools.
  Columns: Date
  Rows affected: 47
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Department column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Department
  Rows affected: 47
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Department column appears to contain near-duplicate values that differ only slightly, such as spacing or casing changes.
  Columns: Department
  Rows affected: 47
  Auto-fixable: ❌
- The Currency column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Currency
  Rows affected: 46

  Columns: Amount
  Rows affected: 45
  Auto-fixable: ✅
- The Amount column contains outlier values that look unusually large or small compared with the rest of the file.
  Columns: Amount
  Rows affected: 45
  Auto-fixable: ❌
- The Status column uses inconsistent capitalisation, which can split what should be one category into several versions.
  Columns: Status

- The Status column appears to contain near-duplicate values that differ only slightly, such as spacing or casing changes.
  Columns: Status

SECTION 4 — COLUMN BREAKDOWN
Employee Name | name | 4.35% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible PII detected (emails/phones/names)
Department | categorical | 8.7% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible duplicates with slight differences
Date | date | 8.7% null | Mixed date formats detected; Inconsistent capitalisation
Amount | currency/amount | 13.04% null | Possible duplicates with slight differences; Outliers detected (values outside 3 standard deviations)
Currency | currency code | 10.87% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible duplicates with slight differences
Category | categorical | 13.04% null | No major issues detected
Status | categorical | 15.22% null | Inconsistent capitalisation; Possible duplicates with slight differences
Notes | free text | 15.22% null | No major issues detected

SECTION 5 — RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. Run sheet-doctor healing now: it can automatically address 8 issue type(s) across 13 flagged issue instance(s)
2. Review 5 row(s) in the Quarantine tab that could not be repaired safely
3. Manually inspect 11 cleaned row(s) still flagged `needs_review=TRUE` before relying on them downstream
4. Normalize mixed date formats in Date (4 formats across about 47 populated row(s)) (auto-fixable)
5. Review near-duplicate values in Department, Currency, Amount, Status to decide which versions should be merged or kept
6. Manually check outlier values in Amount before trusting totals or downstream analysis

SECTION 6 — ASSUMPTIONS
• Rows that still contain Excel formulas as text (for example '=SUM(...)') are quarantined because they are not stable data values
• Ambiguous DD/MM vs MM/DD dates: day-first assumed; fallback to month-first if day-first is impossible
• MM-DD-YY two-digit years: treated as 2000–2049 for YY < 50, 1950–1999 for YY ≥ 50
• Unix timestamps: interpreted as UTC; converted to YYYY-MM-DD
• Excel serial dates: Windows epoch (1899-12-30); range 40,000–55,000 treated as dates
• European decimal 1.200,00: detected when period precedes comma; converted to 1200.00
• Combined values like '$1,200 USD' are split so Amount keeps the numeric value and Currency keeps the ISO code
• Blank / N/A / TBD amounts: cleared to empty string and flagged needs_review=TRUE
• "INR ₹" and similar symbol+code combos: symbol stripped, ISO code kept
• "Eng" department abbreviation: kept as-is (expanding abbreviations requires a lookup table)
• Short blank runs in categorical columns are forward-filled when they look like merged-cell export gaps; filled rows are flagged for review
• Rows with long single-cell prose are treated as notes/metadata rather than transactional data
• Rows labelled TOTAL/Subtotal/SUM are quarantined when the amount matches the running total closely enough to look calculated
• Near-duplicate rows (same Name/Amount/Currency/Category, date within 2 days): both kept, both flagged
• Exact duplicates: first occurrence kept; subsequent occurrences removed and logged
• Short rows (< 8 columns): padded with empty strings; flagged needs_review=TRUE
• Metadata export row (sparse, 1/8 fields filled): quarantined as 'Less than 50% columns filled'
